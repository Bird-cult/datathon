# TODO: 

## predict the probability thing
logistic regression, MLP, random forest etc

## cluster analysis
very nice here

## test models on these data
SEM, from the literature or something

## Missingness: Tonto
-> we can use this together with a bayesian model for missing data

## Exteral data
- deanonymize the dataset, find company

## Some sort of NLP
scrape twitter per country for that date,
e.g. see how big companies are perceived against small? Hard to do without external data (names of companies) at the very least

## Visualization:
find something to visualize

## outliers
find outliers (isolation forest or something)

# Things to ask


## Credit Dataset

Take a look, that's what we are using.

## Cycling Dataset (out of interest, since we are doing the other dataset):

1) What exactly is EventProcessedUtcTime and EventEnqueuedUtcTime with regards to the device. (see histogram about their relationships).

	=> only use one

2) lon lat maybe fixed
